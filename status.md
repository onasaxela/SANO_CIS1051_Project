Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have the basic skeleton of the code and equations set up. All I have to do is find a working equation that works for all situations for that specific scenario. (should be easier than it sounds). I also have to add the turtle pop up.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not found how to get shear stress and strain equations using python. I am currently looking into how to graph equations to python.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Current problem is just trial and error finding an equation that works for each scenario. Also finding a way to streamline the code because there are a lot of inputs required
