# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Mechanics of Solids Time saver for Rigid Beams
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
A program that will calculate the deformation and deflection of a beam.
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My program will utilize file reading in python to determine material properties (i.e. Young's modulus, Shear modulus). I would also take user input for applied forces and lengths. This software will allow for multiple forms of beams to be analyzed using If statements. For example, if the user wants to have 1 or two supports, it will ask the user and depedning on what the user says, it will go into that for loop. I would also like to include a turtle monitor to show up to clarify what the code is asking for and what beam options there are. This would also make it easier to show what materials are available for the user to chose from. For each specific beam, I  will define a function for it.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
 A good outcome for this project is that it is able to output reaction forces correctly for both applied force points and uniform loads. I plan to make this code work only for determinant structures. (Statistically indeterminant structures are not easy to do by hand and wholly variable based on the situation.) If I could even make this work with one specific beam and have it output deflection and deformation, I will be happy. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
If I could even make this work with one specific beam and have it output deflection and deformation, I will be happy. I would like to add inertia calculations if for only a few shapes. 
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The absolute best outcome for this project is that I can take user input for any statistically determinant problem in my textbook and have it output the wanted deformation/deflection value. I want this to work for many different beams and loading conditions. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The first step is to look through my class notes and problems to figure out if there is a step by step process that I could write into code. I will first look at which equations I will need to use in the code. I will need to look at file reading and how it can pull a specific number from a table. I will also need to create a table from the textbook with all the values I could need. Then its just putting the code together with it doing the right calculations with the right numbers. I think the biggest obstacle will be that there are a lot of ways I can take user input and how complex I want the problems I want to calculate to be.
