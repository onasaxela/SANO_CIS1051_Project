# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
For the final project, I am thinking about doing a very basic tamagochi. It will take input from the user to name the pet. And the needs of the pet will be taken care of using input. I brifely looked up a timer function to use within python so that the food and hygiene of the pet will decrease over time.

In addition, I thought of doing a deflection calculator. I'm a mechanical engineering major and I am taking a Mechanics of Solids course and it would be cool to take data about each material and then input the magtidude of the force and distance to calculate torsion, deflection, and strain. It would pull from file with all the data and material properties. I could possibly have a turtle module to pop up to have an example beam.
